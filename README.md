# simple-two-player-Monster-Hunt-Game
In this game, players (called "Catchers") take turns capturing monsters placed randomly on a 10×10 grid. Each monster has a location and energy value. When a catcher captures a monster, they move to the monster’s location and collect the monster’s energy. At the end of the game, the player with more energy wins.
